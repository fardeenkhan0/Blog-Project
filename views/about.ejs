        After learning the fundamentals of data analytics, it is time to apply
        your skills by working on projects. Companies prefer recruiting students
        with multiple project experiences, and they are looking for employees
        who are good at data ingestion and cleaning, data manipulation,
        probability and statistics, predictive analytics, and reporting. It is
        not about learning a new language or tools. It is all about
        understanding the data and extracting important information. You need to
        work on multiple projects to get better at understanding the data and
        producing reports for non-technical people.
